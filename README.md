Aspiring data analyst skilled in R, Python, and SQL, with a strong foundation in natural language processing, traditional statistics, and academic research (including dissertation work). I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights that go beyond surface-level numbers, especially at the intersection of economics and data science. I enjoy translating complex data into actionable stories and enjoy projects that combine rigorous analysis with real-world impact.
